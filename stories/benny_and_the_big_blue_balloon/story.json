benny and the big blue balloon

Text:
Benny found a big blue balloon in the park.
It floated high and shiny in the sun.
He held the string tight so it wouldn’t fly away!

Illustration idea:
A cheerful boy named Benny standing in a sunny park, holding a bright blue balloon. Trees, grass, and maybe a picnic in the background.

Text:
“Let’s go on an adventure!” said Benny.
The balloon bobbed and bounced in the breeze.
It looked like it wanted to explore too!

Illustration idea:
Benny walking down a park path with the balloon tugging forward, both looking excited for an adventure. Maybe a butterfly or a bird nearby.

Text:
They went past the pond with the quacking ducks.
The ducks thought the balloon was the moon!
Benny giggled and waved.

Illustration idea:
A pond full of ducks looking up at the balloon, with Benny waving and laughing. Ripples in the water, cattails by the pond.

Text:
Up a little hill they climbed together.
The wind whooshed and the balloon tugged hard.
“Whoa, not so fast!” Benny laughed.

Illustration idea:
Benny climbing a grassy hill, leaning back as the balloon pulls forward. His hair and scarf blowing in the wind.

Text:
Oh no! The balloon slipped from Benny’s hand!
Up, up, up it went into the sky.
Benny watched it float away until it was just a dot.

Illustration idea:
The blue balloon drifting higher and higher into the sky while Benny looks up with wide eyes, one hand reaching out.

Text:
Benny smiled and whispered, “Goodbye, balloon.”
He knew the balloon was having its own adventure now.
And tomorrow—he’d find a new one! 🎈

Illustration idea:
Benny smiling under a sunset sky, the last speck of blue balloon far away, maybe holding a new red balloon string waiting for another day.
